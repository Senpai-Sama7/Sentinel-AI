## 🚀 Introduction

Sentinel AI is more than just a code search tool—it's a production-grade cognitive engine that *understands* the meaning, context, and history of your code and documentation. Picture transforming your codebase into a dynamic, queryable knowledge base that can answer your questions, adapt to changes, and even anticipate your next needs.

Great software isn’t just code—it’s living knowledge. Sentinel AI connects the dots between your code, your documentation, and your team's decisions, helping you build, debug, and scale faster than ever before.

## 🧠 How Sentinel AI Works & Architecture

Sentinel AI runs on a multi-layer Cached Augmented Generation (CAG) architecture. Rather than re-processing every query from scratch, it uses intelligent layers of memory and context to provide instant, insightful answers.

### Memory Layers

- **L0: Neural Cache** – Ultra-fast in-memory cache for your most common queries (like muscle memory).
- **L1: Distributed Memory** – Redis-powered team cache, so everyone benefits from shared knowledge.
- **L2: Semantic Memory** – Vector databases (ChromaDB/Weaviate) and graph analytics for deep understanding and code-document mapping.
- **L3: Source of Truth** – Your Git repo for complete historical context, allowing Sentinel to reason about why code has changed.

### Core Components

- **⚡ FastAPI:** High-performance API for all interactions.
- **🔬 Rust AST Parser:** Lightning-fast code analysis for multiple languages.
- **🖥️ Next.js Frontend:** Clean, modern UI for developers.
- **🤖 Multi-Modal Engine:** Blends insights from code, docs, PDFs, and commit messages for full context.

### Visual Overview

```
[Developer] <-> [Frontend UI (Next.js)] <-> [FastAPI Gateway]
           |         |                        |
        [Redis L1] [ChromaDB/Weaviate L2]   [Git L3]
           |                                 |
      [In-Process L0]               [Rust AST, Go Vector]
```

## 🎯 What Can Sentinel AI Do?

1. **Search code and documentation with natural language**

   - "Find our primary authentication middleware."
   - "Which documents describe our data retention policy?"
   - "Show me all error handling in payment flows since Q1."

2. **Understand code history and rationale**

   - Track *why* code changed, not just what changed.
   - Surface architectural rationale for changes.
   - Identify patterns of technical debt over time.

3. **Reveal hidden relationships and context across your codebase**

   - Temporal modeling: Visualize how your codebase evolves.
   - Topological analysis: Map hidden dependencies.
   - Cross-modal fusion: Gain a holistic view across code, docs, and commits.
   - Continuous learning: Sentinel adapts to your team’s patterns and vocabulary.

4. **Analyze code deeply with advanced AST tools**

   - Parse Python, JS/TS, Rust, Go, and more.
   - Extract function signatures, find complex patterns, and map dependencies.
   - Generate autonomous documentation and enable smarter code reviews.

## ⚡ Quickstart

> **TL;DR:** Get up and running in minutes—just clone, configure, and launch.

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key (for deep cognitive features)

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Senpai-Sama7/Sentinel-AI.git
cd Sentinel-AI
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to .env
```

### 3. Launch Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 4. Access Interfaces

- **API Docs:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Health:** [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)

> *For local dev: run FastAPI & Next.js separately. For production: see **`helm/`** for Kubernetes deployment.*
