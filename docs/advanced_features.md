# Advanced Features

This document summarizes the new modules providing AI/ML awareness.

## Temporal Sequence Modeling
- `TemporalSequenceLogger` records user actions with timestamps.
- `LSTMPredictor` offers a simple PyTorch LSTM for forecasting actions.
- API endpoint: `POST /advanced/temporal/{user_id}` to log actions and view the sequence.

## Topological Awareness
- `TopologicalAnalyzer` extracts persistence diagrams and clustering labels using **giotto-tda** and **scikit-learn**.
- API endpoint: `GET /advanced/topology/cluster` returns cluster assignments.

## Multi-Agent Simulation
- `MultiAgentSimulator` demonstrates collaborative optimization via a minimal Particle Swarm Optimization routine.
- API endpoint: `POST /advanced/agents/run` runs the simulation.

## Multi-Modal Fusion
- `MultiModalFusion` fuses vectors from different modalities.
- API endpoint: `POST /advanced/fuse` returns a fused vector.

## Personalization & Continuous Learning
- `UserProfileManager` stores simple user preferences.
- `OnlineTrainer` collects feedback and performs dummy training steps.
- API endpoints: `/advanced/profile/{user_id}` and `/advanced/learn`.

These modules act as stubs for future expansion and integrate with the existing FastAPI service.
