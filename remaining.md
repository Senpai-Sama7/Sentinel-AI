# # Semantic Memory: Remaining Tasks for GitHub Distribution

This document outlines the comprehensive roadmap to take the **semantic-memory** micro-service from code completion to a production-grade, community-ready GitHub project. It covers ingestion, testing, CI/CD, deployment, observability, documentation, community governance, and release processes.

---

## 1. Initial Data Ingestion & Validation

**Summary:**

* **Bootstrap Ingestion:** Run ingestion against sample fixtures and external repositories with OCR verification.
* **Index Integrity:** Verify vector counts and search relevance through semantic queries.
* **Automated Testing:** Execute smoke and regression tests on every pull request and daily.

1. **Bootstrap the Pipeline**

   * Invoke `POST /api/v1/memory/ingest` for local fixtures (`memory/data-repo/sample-docs`) and external document sources (PDF, DOCX, Markdown, images).
   * Archive ingestion logs for auditing and troubleshooting.
   * Validate OCR accuracy by comparing recognized text against ground truth for sample images.

2. **Confirm Index & Search Accuracy**

   * Query the vector store to ensure the total number of embeddings matches the sum of document chunk counts.
   * Perform semantic search tests:

     * **Keyword matching:** Confirm top‑3 results include the correct documents.
     * **Semantic similarity:** Verify paraphrased queries return relevant matches.
   * Log any discrepancies or performance issues (e.g., slow indexing operations).

3. **Automated Smoke & Regression Tests**

   * Create a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ingest-smoke.yml`) that:

     * Ingests a minimal fixture repository on each push and pull request.
     * Runs a predefined semantic search and asserts both schema and HTTP status.
   * Add regression tests for edge conditions (empty files, extremely large documents, unsupported formats).

## 2. Environment & CI/CD Configuration

**Summary:**

* **Secrets Management:** Ensure all required environment variables are documented and configured.
* **CI Enhancements:** Add environment linting, matrix testing, and dependency auditing.
* **Branch Policies:** Enforce protected branches, reviews, and status checks.

1. **Secrets Management**

   * Populate GitHub Secrets for `JWT_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`, `CHROMA_HOST`, `CHROMA_PORT`, `APP_CORS_ORIGINS`, `LOG_LEVEL`, and any feature flags.
   * Update `.env.example` with descriptive comments for each variable (purpose, format, default).

2. **Continuous Integration Improvements**

   * **Environment Linting:** Add a CI job that fails when required environment variables are absent.
   * **Matrix Testing:** Execute tests on Python 3.9–3.12 across Linux and macOS runners.
   * **Dependency Auditing:** Incorporate `pip-audit` to detect vulnerable Python packages.
   * Trigger consistency checks when `.env.example` changes.

3. **Branch & Merge Policies**

   * Protect `main` and `release/*` branches requiring:

     * At least two approving code reviews.
     * All status checks (lint, tests, coverage) passing.
     * Automatic dismissal of stale reviews on new commits.

## 3. GitHub Workflows & Release Automation

**Summary:**

* **Workflow Audit:** Ensure complete coverage for formatting, linting, testing, and scanning.
* **Security Scanning:** Integrate image and code scanning tools.
* **Release Pipeline:** Automate version bumps, tagging, packaging, and publishing.

1. **Audit and Enhance Workflows**

   * Verify existing jobs cover:

     * Code formatting (`make format`)
     * Linting (`make lint`)
     * Type checking (`make type-check`)
     * Unit and integration tests
     * Coverage reports and Docker builds
   * Add a pre‑release check that enforces 100% test coverage.

2. **Security Scanning**

   * Embed Trivy scanning immediately after Docker image builds.
   * Integrate Snyk or GitHub CodeQL for static analysis of Helm charts and manifests.

3. **Automated Releases**

   * Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` to:

     1. Bump versions in `pyproject.toml` and `helm/Chart.yaml` per semantic versioning.
     2. Run the full CI suite.
     3. Tag the commit with `vX.Y.Z`.
     4. Build and push images to GitHub Container Registry.
     5. Package and publish the Helm chart to an OCI or GitHub Pages registry.
     6. Populate GitHub Release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
   * Safeguard against accidental release candidates on `main`.

## 4. Helm Chart & Kubernetes Deployment

**Summary:**

* **Helm Configuration:** Harden defaults, document flags, and configure ingress/TLS.
* **Deployment Strategies:** Automate staging, canary, and production rollouts.
* **Linting & Documentation:** Ensure chart quality and generate user-friendly docs.

1. **Harden Values & Defaults**

   * Set realistic resource requests and limits in `helm/values.yaml` (e.g., CPU 250m, Memory 512Mi).
   * Annotate optional flags with inline comments.

2. **Ingress & TLS Configuration**

   * Provide examples for nginx and Traefik ingress:

     * Host, path rules, and HTTP-to-HTTPS annotations.

## 5. Observability & Monitoring

**Summary:**

* **Dashboards & Alerts:** Define Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alert rules.
* **Tracing & Logging:** Ensure end‑to‑end tracing and structured logging.
* **Metrics Documentation:** Document key metrics and provide health‑check scripts.

1. **Grafana & Prometheus**

   * Store dashboard JSONs in `docs/dashboards/` (e.g., `ingestion-overview.json`, `rag-latency.json`).
   * Define alert rules for:

     * `/ingest` error rate >5% over 5 minutes
     * L1 cache miss ratio >20%
     * p95 RAG latency >2 seconds
