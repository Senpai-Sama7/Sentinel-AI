### **README - (For Non-Technical Users)**

This document is for product managers, stakeholders, or even other teams who need to understand *what* the system does and *how* to interact with it at a high level, without needing to understand the code. It avoids jargon where possible and focuses on purpose and results.

## **User Manual: The Sentinel AI Memory System**

### **1. What is the Sentinel System?**

Think of the Sentinel System as a super-smart library for our AI. Normally, an AI might forget things or have to re-read the same document over and over. Sentinel gives our AI a perfect, multi-layered memory so it can:

*   **Remember Instantly:** Access frequently needed information in a fraction of a second (like a sticky note on its desk).
*   **Understand Meaning:** Not just read words, but understand the *concepts* within our project documentation (like having read and understood every book in the library).
*   **Know Our Code's History:** Access any version of any file from our project's history instantly (like a perfect, searchable archive).

By having this powerful memory, our AI can answer questions, analyze code, and generate solutions faster, more accurately, and with more context than ever before.

### **2. What Can You Do With It?**

The Sentinel System provides a simple API that allows other applications to ask it questions. Here are the main things you can do:

#### **A. Retrieve a File from a Project**

You can ask Sentinel for the exact content of any file from a specific point in our project's history.

*   **What it's for:**
    *   Getting the "source of truth" for a piece of code.
    *   Allowing an AI to read a file before analyzing it.
    *   Comparing how a file looked last week versus today.
*   **How to do it (Example):**
    *   You would make an API call to an endpoint like: `GET /api/v1/memory/file/src/app/main.py`
*   **What you get back:**
    *   The complete text content of that file.

#### **B. Perform a "Smart Search" (Semantic Search)**

You can ask Sentinel a question in plain English, and it will find the most relevant sections from all our project documentation (like README files, design docs, etc.).

*   **What it's for:**
    *   Finding documentation related to a feature without knowing the exact file name.
    *   Asking questions like, "How does our user authentication work?"
    *   Giving an AI the background reading it needs to understand a task.
*   **How to do it (Example):**
    *   You would make an API call to `POST /api/v1/memory/search` with a query like:
      ```json
      {
        "query": "What is the process for deploying a new version?"
      }
      ```
*   **What you get back:**
    *   A list of the most relevant text snippets from our documentation that best answer your question.

#### **C. Store a New Piece of Information**

You can tell Sentinel to remember a new piece of information. This is useful for storing the results of an AI's analysis so it doesn't have to do the same work twice.

*   **What it's for:**
    *   Saving an AI's summary of a complex file.
    *   Caching the answer to a frequently asked question.
*   **How to do it (Example):**
    *   You would make an API call to `POST /api/v1/memory/cache` with the information to save:
      ```json
      {
        "key": "summary_of_main.py",
        "value": "This file is the main entry point for the web server..."
      }
      ```
*   **What you get back:**
    *   A confirmation that the information was successfully saved.

### **3. How Does This Help Our Business?**

*   **Faster Development:** Our AI tools can work more efficiently, reducing the time it takes to analyze code and develop new features.
*   **Increased Accuracy:** By having access to all relevant context (both code and documentation), the AI makes fewer mistakes and produces higher-quality results.
*   **Better Onboarding:** New developers can use the system to quickly ask questions about the codebase and find relevant documentation, speeding up their learning process.
*   **Preserves Knowledge:** Important information stored in documentation is made easily accessible and is never lost, even as team members change.
